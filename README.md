# Awesome-Coursera-Mini-Projects
Coursera project network has provided numerous guided projects. I personally think it is a great place to touch new skills and build your own Minimum Viable Products (MVP).
Here I will gather and link to the Best Mini-Projects I recently done on Coursera Project Network. **I have done all the guided projects in my recommendation list**. Hope they are inspiring to you as well!

## What are Guided Projects?
With Guided Projects, you can learn a job-relevant skill in under two hours. Guided Projects offer an interactive experience that includes step-by-step instructions from a subject matter expert. Everything you need to complete a Guided Project is available right in your browser. No software or prior experience is required to get started.
